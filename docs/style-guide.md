# CTS Partners Content Style Guide

## Brand Voice

### Core Attributes

**Professional Yet Approachable**
We are seasoned experts with decades of experience, but we communicate in clear, accessible language. We avoid unnecessary jargon and explain complex concepts in ways that resonate with both technical and business audiences.

**Action-Oriented**
Our content focuses on outcomes, results, and value delivered. We emphasize what we do and the impact we create, not just what we know.

**Confident Without Arrogance**
We demonstrate expertise through our track record, specific examples, and measurable results—not through boastful claims or self-promotion.

**Forward-Looking**
We position ourselves at the intersection of technology and business strategy, with a particular focus on AI, automation, and digital transformation. We help clients navigate change and capitalize on emerging opportunities.

## Writing Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Write for Your Audience**
   - Primary: Private equity investors, corporate development teams, portfolio company executives
   - Secondary: Investment bankers, asset managers, technology leaders
   - Assume business sophistication but not necessarily deep technical expertise

2. **Be Specific and Concrete**
   - Use real examples and case studies where possible
   - Include metrics and quantifiable results
   - Avoid vague statements like "we help companies succeed"

3. **Use Active Voice**
   - Good: "We accelerate value creation through technical due diligence"
   - Bad: "Value creation is accelerated through technical due diligence"

4. **Keep It Concise**
   - Get to the point quickly
   - Use short sentences and paragraphs
   - Break up long sections with headers

### Terminology

**Preferred Terms:**
- M&A (not M&A transactions or MA&D unless specifically referring to divestitures)
- Private equity (not PE on first reference)
- Portfolio company (not portfolio co. or portco)
- Due diligence (not DD)
- Artificial intelligence or AI (be consistent within a document)
- Technical due diligence (not tech DD or TDD)

**Avoid:**
- Buzzwords without substance (synergy, leverage, paradigm shift)
- Overly technical jargon without explanation
- Clichés (best-in-class, world-class, unless backed by evidence)
- Hyperbole (revolutionary, game-changing, unless truly applicable)

### Formatting Conventions

**Headers:**
- Page title: `# Title` (H1)
- Major sections: `## Section` (H2)
- Subsections: `### Subsection` (H3)
- Use sentence case for headers, not title case

**Emphasis:**
- Use **bold** for key terms and important concepts
- Use *italics* sparingly, primarily for emphasis or foreign terms
- Do not use ALL CAPS for emphasis

**Lists:**
- Use bulleted lists for unordered items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps or ranked items
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Use complete sentences or consistent fragments

**Links:**
- Use descriptive link text, not "click here"
- Good: "Learn more about our [technical due diligence services](#)"
- Bad: "Click [here](#) to learn more"

## Tone by Content Type

### Homepage / Landing Pages
- Confident and compelling
- Focus on value proposition
- Clear calls to action
- Balance aspiration with credibility

### Service Pages
- Detailed but accessible
- Focus on client benefits and outcomes
- Use specific examples
- Include process descriptions where helpful

### About / Team Pages
- Professional but personable
- Highlight relevant experience and expertise
- Use concrete achievements
- Show personality without being casual

### Case Studies / Testimonials
- Results-focused
- Specific and quantifiable
- Client-centric (their success, not our greatness)
- Authentic and credible

## SEO Guidelines

### Keywords

Primary keywords to incorporate naturally:
- Technical due diligence
- M&A advisory
- Private equity technology
- Digital transformation
- AI strategy
- Portfolio company optimization
- Technology integration
- Carve-out services

### Meta Descriptions

- 150-160 characters
- Include primary keyword
- Compelling and action-oriented
- Unique for each page

### Headers

- Use headers to structure content logically
- Include keywords naturally in headers
- Make headers descriptive and scannable

## Examples

### Good Example

"Our technical due diligence process combines deep technical expertise with business context, giving private equity investors a clear picture of operational readiness and potential value. We conduct pre- and post-close assessments that measure scalability, reliability, and product health, while identifying technical debt and modernization priorities that could impact returns."

**Why it works:**
- Specific about what we do
- Focused on client benefit
- Uses concrete terms
- Active voice
- Professional but accessible

### Poor Example

"We leverage our world-class expertise to deliver best-in-class solutions that drive synergies and create value for our clients across the entire M&A lifecycle."

**Why it doesn't work:**
- Vague and generic
- Buzzword-heavy
- No specific value proposition
- Could apply to any consulting firm
